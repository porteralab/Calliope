_________________________
1. Starting a new project

ProjectDefaults_XXX     generate your ProjectDefaults file from a template to define backup locations, paths, etc. related to your project.
newProjectExpLog        create a new project entry in the ExpLog database
listProjectsExplog      shows a list of existing projects in the ExpLog database
newMouseExpLog          create a new mouse in the ExpLog database

2. backing up data

primary_backup          use to backup data from temp locations on recording rigs to RawData directories on servers. Note this funciton uses the paths defined in your ProjectDefaults file.

_______________________________________________
3. Registering, ROI-ing, & calculation activity

a. Use calliope to register the data ('reg. dir' button). This will take about as long as acquisition took. 
b. Use calliope to select ROIs ('select ROIs' button). 
c. Use calliope to calculate activity ('calc act' button). 

proj_info                   shows all sites of a project
check_siteROIs              displays the current ROI-ing status, how many ROIs selected etc. for all data of one site. graphically displays ROIs.
change_siteID               change the ID of a site from one experiment to another.
correct_dxdy                use to fix registration by replacing registration of one layer with another, etc.
register_exp_downsample     register again downsampling the data (i.e. averaging) - start with 3
register_exp_fixoutliers    try to correct single outliers
delete_roi                  delete single roi during ROI-ing

4. generating a meta file

set_adata_code          use this GUI to set the adata code of your experiments. The idea here is that you can group experiments. 
generateMetaInfo        use this file to generate a meta info file. This is an excel file stored on M that can be modified manually to add tags and information to individual experiments that are integrated into the meta file. 
get_proj_metaData       use to generate a project meta file. 
fix_my_meta_file_log    use to add descriptions to the meta file log

___________________
5. general analysis

trig2snps               calculates snippets of activity for given indices
plotTriggeredAverage    plots average triggered activity, e.g. cell on PS
clap                    clear all variables in workspace except proj_meta
ca                      close all figures except calliope
act2mat			converts all zls of one site and tp to a matrix
snp_browser		visualize trig2snps one or several output(s)

6. managing your data

check_disk_space        check how much disk space is free on all servers
check_backup            checks backup status of one animal, project or user
clean_backup            lists all files in RawData directories that are not in ExpLog
check_archive           checks data use in the archive
archive_project         copy all data of one project to the archive

_______________________
7. publishing your work

create_submissionArchive     this function will genrate a snapshot of all the code necessary to generate your figures. you should have one core script "generate_XXX_figures" where XXX is your project ID that generates all figures in the manuscript.
